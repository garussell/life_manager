## Life Manager

This is an application I am creating for my own purposes.  It will scrape my email and calendar for things I need to manage in my life, such as bank transactions, calendar events, job inquiries, and whatever else I decide.  It is using plain Ruby, no Rails.  I am using `Nokogiri` gem to do some scraping.  I am also using PostgreSQL, and since there is no Object Relational Mapper in this projected, the database and CRUD operations will be performed with raw SQL.  I used Postico 2 to create the database and initialized the connection using the `pg` gem, and a Plain Old Ruby Object.
